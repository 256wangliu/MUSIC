\title{
Evaluating the offtarget effect of sgRNAs.
}
\description{
sgRNA offtarget effect may exist for these novel type of data due to the application of CRISPR screening technique. For CRISPRi technique, MUSIC wonâ€™t consider this step, since CRISPRi knockdown is specific with minimal off-target effects. MUSIC integrates sgRNA sequence information with its corresponding perturbation expression to determine whether the sgRNA has induced an off-target effect. By our analysis for such data, offtargets were not found, so you may skip this step if you want to save time or you don't have sgRNA sequence . The pipeline works fine even though this step isn't performed.
